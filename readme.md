# Documentation

This repo contains markdown documentation describing Catalyst Squad's thoughts on how to approach Kafka and the [Strimzi Operator](https://strimzi.io/) in Kubernetes. It is following the [Four Divio Documentation Types](https://documentation.divio.com/) which are tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference, and explanation documentation.

If you don't have a specific topic to start with the [Kafka Concepts](/explanation/concepts.md)

## Status

This is in draft mode, and as such is unversioned. It currently uses Mermaid for diagrams. Updates must be made in a PR.

If you wish to make a change, create a branch and PR to `main` which you should then reach out however you wish to @catalystcommunity/Core to look.
